    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Kevin Zong and I was born in New York, but grew up in Rhode Island. I am a student at the Harvard Extension School where I am majoring in Business Admin and Management. I am also pursuing minors in Computer Science and Digital Media. Currently, I am working and living in Singapore.</p>
    <p>My web development background stems from HES, where I have taken several courses on HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. With these studies, I created a website for my mother's small business.</p>
    <p>My experience in software development is extremely limited, though, having only taken a single course on Python.</p>
    <p>I was interested in taking this course because I enjoyed working in JS. A lot of the work felt like puzzle-solving, and that was what made it fun for me. Single Page Web Applications are interesting to me because I use them extremely frequently in my day-to-day. There is a lot of functionality that can be found in SPAs which has me curious as to how they are built.</p>
